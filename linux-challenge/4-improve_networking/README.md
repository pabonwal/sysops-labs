# IMPROVE NETWORKING

### Task
Youâ€™ll need to optimize the networking setup in the company to avoid leading to bottlenecks in data transfer.

### Approach
On-premise infrastructure, a very regular company datacenter

## STEPS
+ Define some performance metrics (bandwidth, latency, packet loss, availability, error rate, etc)
+ Network monitoring tools can help to detect bottlenecks and low latency (NetFlow, OpenNMS)
+ Sniffers can help to find network errors or malformed packets
+ Review of network topology and design
+ Load-balancing for critical applications
+ QoS to prioritize network traffic
+ Upgrade of network hardware if required
